## Features

- Paint or erase polygons with an integrated brush tool
- Switch classes instantly with number key hotkeys

**Note:** The brush tool requires the target layer to be in editing mode. If the layer isn't editable, drawing will warn and abort.

- **Left-click + drag**: Paint polygons
- **Right-click + drag**: Erase areas
- **Shift + scroll**: Adjust brush size
- **Ctrl + Shift + scroll**: Rotate brush
- **Tab**: Cycle through brush shapes
- **Ctrl while drawing**: Merge with existing features

## Installation

1. Copy the `class_labeler` plugin folder to your QGIS profile's plugins directory
2. Enable **Class Labeler** in the QGIS Plugin Manager
3. Open the dock widget or toolbar to start labeling

## Release publishing

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that packages the plugin and
publishes it to the official QGIS plugin repository whenever a GitHub release
is published. Before triggering a release, configure the following secrets in
your GitHub repository settings:

- `QGIS_PLUGIN_REPO_USERNAME`
- `QGIS_PLUGIN_REPO_PASSWORD`

These credentials correspond to your QGIS plugin repository account and are
used by the workflow to authenticate when uploading the packaged plugin.

## Usage

1. Select a target polygon layer and set the class field
2. Add class values and assign them to hotkeys (1â€“9)
3. Use the brush to paint or erase while switching classes with the hotkeys

## Acknowledgements

This plugin builds on the [Draw-By-Brush](https://github.com/josephburkhart/Draw-By-Brush) tool by Joseph Burkhart.
